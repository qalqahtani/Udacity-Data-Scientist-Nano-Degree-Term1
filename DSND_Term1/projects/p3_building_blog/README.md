## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and the libraries in requirments.txt file. You can simply install them using this command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.6.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Boston Airbnb data to better understand:

1. When is the peak of Boston airbnb prices?
2. Which area in Boston has the highest prices?
3. What is the mean renting price for each property?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 files used in this analysis 2 for the dataset and 1 notebook to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@qubayl.qh/answering-questions-about-boston-airbnb-data-d20717bf9e38).
